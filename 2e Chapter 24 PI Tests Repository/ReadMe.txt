Programming Entity Framework 2nd Edition

Chapter 24, Building Persistent Ignorant, Testable Applications


This C# solution contains the entire solution built up in Chapter 24. It has projects created in earlier chapters plus new ones - repositories, tests, interfaces and a small console app to demo using the infrastructure with a UI.


The current connection string in the test and console projects' app.config points to a local sql server 2008 database. If you are using SQL Server Express, you should change the data source from . to .\SQLExpress.
