Chapter 9, Data Binding with Windows Formsand WPF Applications

This is the Windows Presentation Foundation application from this chapter.

This sample contains a C# Solution which contains two projects that define the WPF application built in Chapter 9. 

1) The current version of the BreakAway model created in Chapter 8.

2) The WPF project.

The current connection string in the project's app.points to a local sql server 2008 database. If you are using SQL Server Express, you should change the data source from . to .\SQLExpress.
