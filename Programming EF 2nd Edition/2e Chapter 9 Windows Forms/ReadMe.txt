Chapter 9, Data Binding with Windows Formsand WPF Applications

This is the Windows Forms application from this chapter.

This sample contains a C# Solution which contains two projects that define the WinForms application built in Chapter 9. 

1) The current version of the BreakAway model created in Chapter 8.

2) The Windows Forms project.

3) The Console App UI  client

The current connection string in the project's app.points to a local sql server 2008 database. If you are using SQL Server Express, you should change the data source from . to .\SQLExpress.
