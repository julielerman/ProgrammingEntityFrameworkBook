Chapter 26, Using Entities in Layered Client-Side Applications

This C# solution contains the entire solution built up in Chapter 26. It has projects created in earlier chapters plus new ones. Because the solution evolved throughout the chapter, the earlier logic is included but commented out. The final solution used POCOs and that is what is the focus of this project, however you can see the code that was used with entityObjects.

The current connection string in the test and console projects' app.config points to a local sql server 2008 database. If you are using SQL Server Express, you should change the data source from . to .\SQLExpress.
