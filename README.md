 All three books focus on Entity Framework 4. 

 The samples were all created in Visual Studio 2010.  They have not been updated as there have been many version of Entity Framework and EF Core in the 11 years since the book was published.

 If you're seeking newer content, please check out [my many EF6 and EF Core courses on Pluralsight](bit.ly/efcore5)!
